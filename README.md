### Responsive Divs (Bootstrap) 
#### Advantages:
* Very easy, quick implementation of fully responsive layout
* Repeatability of containers and intuitive nesting system
* Nearly universal adoption, allowing greater readability between developers 

#### Disadvantages:
* Heavy framework (120kb of CSS alone, included JS doubles the weight of the page)
* Customization requires overriding many styles, and can lead to style complications
* Large number of divs; This particular example comments the end of each containing div to attempt to keep track of each nesting
